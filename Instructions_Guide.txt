World Cup sticker album :
how many stickers do you have to buy to complete the World Cup album?

Data:

    • 640 sticker slots in the album.
    • Each sticker is printed in equal quantities and is randomly distributed.
    • Each pack comes with five stickers.
    • Each pack costs $ 20.
      

1. Create functions that can :

    • Simulate the generation of a pack with 5 stickers, knowing that the album has 640. Note that, as in real life, there can be repeated stickers in a pack.

    • Create a function named genPack(totalStick , stickerPack) that, given the amount of slots (totalStick) and the number of stickers per pack (stickerPack), generates a pack of random stickers. Note that, as in real life, there can be repeated stickers in a pack.

    •  Create a function named howmanypacks(totalStick , stickerPack) that ,given the amount of slots (totalStick) and the number of stickers per pack (stickerPack), simulates the filling of the album and returns how many packs are need to be purchased to complete it.

2. Estimate the distributions and expected values of the variables under study :
	We define  N  as the number of packs needed to complete the album,  C  the amount of money required to 	complete the album,  T  the time required to complete the album and  X  the time (in days) between two 	consecutive purchases of packs, which is known to have an exponential distribution with a rate  of 1. From 	Nrep = 100  simulations/iterations , using  totalStick = 640 , stickerPack = 5 :

    • Estimate and graph the probability functions of  N  and  C  and the density function of  T .

    • Estimate the expected values of  N ,  C  and  T  .
      
    • Repeat the previous items for  Nrep = {10, 200, 500, 1000, 10000} . Draw conclusions based
	on the observed results.
